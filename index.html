                            My name is Jaron Landeen, I am 24 years old. I am the second youngest in my family, I have 3
                            bothers and 1
                            sister. I had the opportunity to live in Sweden for two years, in which I was able to pick
                            up the Swedish
                            language. I have been married for just over two years, and we are expecting our first child
                            in
                            January. I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, and video games. I also enjoy hiking and
                            shooting or just
                            spending
                            my time outside.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I currently work at a small company called Western States Cabling. I am a soldering
                            technician, where we
                            assemble cables for GPS machinery equipment. I used to work as an electrician's apprentice.
                            I'm now
                            attending
                            the coding bootcamp through the University of Utah, so I can improve my computer skills, and
                            eventually
                            get into a career. I would like to be able to have a company of my own, in which I would be
                            using
                            coding for the product I wish to create.
